# winscan - Windows Repair Tool

WinScan is a powershell file portable tool designed to repair corrupt Windows OS (10/11) files and fix disk errors. It achieves this by executing the following commands in the specified order:

1. `SFC /ScanNow`: Scans and repairs Windows system files.
2. `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`: Restores the Windows image from known good files.
3. `CHKDSK`: Optionally, you can run this command to scan local drives for bad sectors (use the `/R` parameter for HDD drives).

## Features

- Automated repair process: Execute all repair commands with a single command.
- Sequential execution: Ensures that the commands run in the correct order.

## Usage

1. Open Powershell as administrator
2. Paste this code in Powershell:
